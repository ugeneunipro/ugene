Domain comprising first 510 aa residues is similar to various multidrug resistance and efflux proteins and contains sugar transport proteins signature 1 (PS00216). Part corresponding to last 550 aa residues contains cyclic nucleotide-binding domain signature 2(PS00889) and is very similar to hypothetical 62.1 kd M. tuberculosisprotein MTCY9C4_3 (31.0% identity in 546 aa overlap). Highly similar to M. tuberculosis gp|Z95121|MTY20B11_14 hypothetical protein (1048 aa), FASTA scores: opt: 4328z-score: 3768.2 E(): 0; 63.2% identity in 1073 aa overlap, N-terminus similar to MTCY3G12_1; MTCY98_2; MTCY369_27 andMTCY180.41c"/>
