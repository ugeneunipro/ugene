#@UGENE_WORKFLOW
#The workflow takes FASTQ files with metagenomic NGS reads as input and process them as follows:
# * Improve reads quality with Trimmomatic
# * Provide FastQC reads quality reports
# * Classification:
#   - Classify the pre-processed reads with Kraken.
#   - Get reads that were not classified by Kraken.
#   - Classify these reads with CLARK.
#   - Get reads that were not classified (in case of SE reads).
#   - Classify these reads with DIAMOND (in case of SE reads).
#   - Provide general classification reports
